Feature: Basic text typing in Visualizer Editor
        As a TDriver script developer,
        I want to manipulate (create, edit, save, open) files using editor.

@pass
        Scenario: Edit new document
                Given visualizer application is ready
                When I make dockwidget "Code Editor" hidden
                And I make dockwidget "Code Editor" visible
                Then dockwidget "editor" visibility is "true"
                And dockwidget title "Code Editor" visibility is "true"
                And editor stuff is ok
                When I trigger menubar "main menubar" action "main file"
                And I trigger menu "main file" action "editor new"
                Then file "" is shown in editor
                When I enter text "Hello"
                Then editor contains "Hello"
                When I trigger menubar "main menubar" action "main edit"
                And I trigger menu "main edit" action "editor undo"
                Then editor contains ""

@pass
@fixture
        Scenario: Edit new document, save, close, load
                Given visualizer application is ready
                Then application has custom fixture
                When I make dockwidget "Code Editor" hidden
                And I make dockwidget "Code Editor" visible
                Then dockwidget "editor" visibility is "true"
                And dockwidget title "Code Editor" visibility is "true"
                And editor stuff is ok
                When I trigger menubar "main menubar" action "main file"
                And I trigger menu "main file" action "editor new"
                Then file "" is shown in editor
                When I enter text "Hello"
                Then editor contains "Hello"
                When I save temporary file "tmp_feature.txt"
                Then temporary file "tmp_feature.txt" is shown in editor
                And temporary file "tmp_feature.txt" exists in filesystem
                When I trigger menubar "main menubar" action "main file"
                And I trigger menu "main file" action "editor close"
                Then editor has no files open
                When I load temporary file "tmp_feature.txt"
                Then temporary file "tmp_feature.txt" is shown in editor
                And editor contains "Hello"
